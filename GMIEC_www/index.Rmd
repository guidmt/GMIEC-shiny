Welcome in **GMIEC**!! **GMIEC** is a framework, GMIEC, that integrates omics data (gene-expression, copy number variation, mutation, methylation) with data containing genomic coordinates of cis and/or trans epigenetic regulators (e.g. ChIP-seq). Then, at the level of the single patient, GMIEC identify groups of genes (modules) that share common genomic features. Then, using an external database, the genes in each module are associated with their own target drugs. Therefore, GMIEC allows the identification, at the level of the single patient, groups of genes that are regulated by the same epigenetic regulators (e.g. TFs), sharing common genomic features and associated with different number of drugs.

#### **Functionalities of GMIEC:**

- Identification of groups of genes with/without genomic alterations associated with drugs using **gene-expression**, **copy-number alteration**, **methylation**, **mutation**, **clinical data**.
- Analysis using only the annotated genes.
- Analysis using only the annotated genes and TF.
- Analysis using a custom list of genes.
- Analysis using all genes between the datasets.

#### **Functionalities of GMIEC-MD/GMIEC-FD**

- Identification of groups of genes with/without genomic alterations associated with drugs using **predefined** number of datasets.
- Analysis using only the annotated genes.
- Analysis using only the annotated genes and TF.
- Analysis using a custom list of genes.
- Analysis using all genes between the datasets.

#### **Functionalities of VIS-GMIEC:**
- Exploration of the data at the level of groups of or single patient
