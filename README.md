# GMIEC-shiny
This is the offical repository of GMIEC-shiny
Welcome in GMIEC!! GMIEC is a framework, GMIEC, that integrates omics data (gene-expression, copy number variation, mutation, methylation) with data containing genomic coordinates of cis and/or trans epigenetic regulators (e.g. ChIP-seq). Then, at the level of the single patient, GMIEC identify groups of genes (modules) that share common genomic features. Then, using an external database, the genes in each module are associated with their own target drugs. Therefore, GMIEC allows the identification, at the level of the single patient, groups of genes that are regulated by the same epigenetic regulators (e.g. TFs), sharing common genomic features and associated with different number of drugs.
Methods:
This shiny application contatin different two modules: GMIEC and FD-GMIEC. The input of GMIEC are: i) a file with the genomic regions of the regulators of interest; ii) omics data; ii) a file that includes the association between genes and drugs. The four principal steps of analysis are: i) the annotation of the epigenetic components (ECs) derived from a catalogue (ReMap) with their target genes; ii) a step of discretization used to mark the presence of one alteration (1) or not (0) for all genes of single patient, considering all datasets (e.g. gene-expression data, copy-number alterations data, mutations data); iii) the genes with the similar genomic features grouped using Association Rules Discovery (ARD) technique.
Functionalities of GMIEC:
Identification of groups of genes with/without genomic alterations associated with drugs using gene-expression, copy-number alteration, methylation, mutation, clinical data.
Analysis using only the annotated genes.
Analysis using only the annotated genes and TF.
Analysis using a custom list of genes.
Analysis using all genes between the datasets.
Functionalities of FD-GMIEC:
Identification of groups of genes with/without genomic alterations associated with drugs using predefined number of datasets.
Analysis using only the annotated genes.
Analysis using only the annotated genes and TF.
Analysis using a custom list of genes.
Analysis using all genes between the datasets.
Functionalities of VIS-GMIEC:
Exploration of the data at the level of groups of or single patient
